Bus Reservation System
Overview
The Bus Reservation System is a software application designed to facilitate the booking and management of bus tickets. It provides a platform for passengers to browse bus schedules, reserve seats, and manage bookings, while enabling administrators to oversee routes, schedules, and passenger data. This project aims to simplify travel planning and enhance operational efficiency for bus operators.
Features

View real-time seat availability and select preferred seats.
Book, cancel, or modify reservations.
Access booking history and download tickets.


Admin Features:
Add, edit, or delete bus routes and schedules.
Manage bus details (e.g., capacity, type).
Monitor bookings and generate passenger reports.


Additional Functionality:
User authentication for secure access.
Responsive interface for web or mobile use.
(Optional) Payment gateway integration for online payments.



Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially with a framework like React or Bootstrap for a modern UI).
Backend: (Assumed) Java with Spring Boot, Python with Django, or a similar framework for handling business logic.
Database: MySQL or SQLite for storing routes, bookings, and user data.
Tools: Git for version control, Maven or pip for dependency management.
